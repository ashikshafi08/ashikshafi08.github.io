As a Machine Learning Engineer specializing in AI and LLM systems, I combine academic excellence with practical innovation in the field of artificial intelligence. Currently pursuing my Master of Computer Science at Illinois Institute of Technology, I've developed expertise in building and optimizing large language models, RAG systems, and autonomous AI solutions.

My role as a Founding Machine Learning Engineer at Nakamoto LLC has allowed me to engineer cutting-edge AI systems, including an autonomous bug-fixing system with LlamaIndex-based RAG and LLM-driven patch generation. I've also contributed to the development of efficient mining solutions and fine-tuning frameworks for mathematical reasoning LLMs.

My technical expertise spans across:
- Advanced ML frameworks: PyTorch, TensorFlow, HuggingFace, LangChain
- AI/ML technologies: RAG, LLMs, Prompt Engineering, Model Quantization
- Full-stack development: Python, FastAPI, Docker, Kubernetes
- Data science: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, SQL
- Cloud & DevOps: AWS, Azure ML, Git, CI/CD

I'm passionate about pushing the boundaries of AI technology and making it more accessible and efficient. My approach combines theoretical knowledge with practical implementation, focusing on creating scalable and robust AI solutions that solve real-world problems.

Beyond technical skills, I actively contribute to the open-source community, having made significant contributions to projects like Bittensor and PyTorch Vision. I believe in the power of collaborative development and continuous learning in the rapidly evolving field of AI.
